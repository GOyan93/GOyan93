- 👋 Hi, I’m @GOyan93
- 👀 I’m interested in casually learning about the intracacies of computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, its various modules, data structures as well as various sorting, searching and pathfinding algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programs to enhance organization and productivity of the everyday user. Eventually I would like to extend this knowledge to mobile applications.
- 📫 How to reach me email will be fine. goyandle@gmail.com
